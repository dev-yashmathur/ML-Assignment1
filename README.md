This repository, part of a semester project, was used to convert speech to sign language in real time*
Steps Include:
-> Convert the Audio to text, in a multi threaded fashion
-> Process these chunks of text to ASL Sign Language
-> Create a ranking of commonly used words, and add in their direct word translations
-> Use a python Tkinter powered GUI to display this sign language in real time.
